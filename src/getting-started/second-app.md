# Your Second Homebrew Application

Having grasped the fundamentals of writing Rust code for the Wii U, it's now time to put that knowledge into practice and embark on your own creative endeavors. Feel free to explore and implement any functionality that sparks your interest.

The `rust-wiiu` documentation serves as a valuable resource, detailing the available standard library-like features and additional tools at your disposal. These include modules such as `wut::screen` for rendering basic graphics and `wut::gamepad` for handling controller inputs.

A highly effective way to gain inspiration and accelerate your learning is to examine existing homebrew applications. By studying their code, understanding their design patterns, and adapting their techniques to your specific needs, you can significantly enhance your development skills and create compelling Wii U applications.
