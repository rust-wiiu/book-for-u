[^1]: Other emulators like [decaf-emu](https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu), etc. exist but I highly recommend sticking to Cemu.
[^2]: Why C/C++? The underlying SDK is built on C libraries, but you likely won't need to interact with them directly unless you go beyond the provided std-like features into unsafe territory. Most C functions are bound to `extern "C"` and can be called directly, requiring some knowledge of the C calling conventionâ€”especially for contributors to this project.
