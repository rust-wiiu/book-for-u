[^1]: Other emulators like [decaf-emu](https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu), etc. exist but I highly recommend sticking to Cemu. It's considered the standard for Wii U emulators.
[^2]: The underlying SDK is built on C libraries, but you likely won't need to interact with them directly unless you go beyond the provided std-like features into [unsafe territory](./unsafe.md). Most C functions are bound to `extern "C"` and can be called directly, requiring some knowledge of the C calling conventionâ€”especially for contributors to this project.
[^3]: Debugging with e.g. the Cemu PPC Debugger can be helpful when directly using the C API. Using the Rust API *should* not require to go to that level at any point. <!-- GDB stub?  -->
